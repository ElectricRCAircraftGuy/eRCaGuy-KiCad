# Project Folders:
* `Libraries` = schematic symbol libraries (`.lib` files), PCB layout footprint libraries (`.pretty` folders w/`.kicad_mod` files), etc.
* `Building_Blocks` = standalone circuits, or circuit snippets, which provide modular functionality.
  * Ex: buck converters, boost converters, MOSFET gate drivers, LDO (Low Drop-Out) Linear voltage regulators, etc.
  * These "building blocks" will probably come in the form of standalone KiCad projects.
  * I have found it to be **sooooo hard** to learn how to make basic (ie: fundamental and widespread, but not necessarily simple or easy-to-do) building blocks, such as:
    * PNP high-side BJT buck converters
    * NPN high-side BJT buck converters (w/charge pump)
    * NPN low-side BJT buck converters
    * enhancement mode P-Ch high-side MOSFET buck converters
    * enhancement mode N-Ch high-side MOSFET buck converters (w/charge pump)
    * enhancement mode N-Ch low-side MOSFET buck converters
    * boost converters of the various varieties mentioned above
    * MOSFET gate drivers using discrete components
    * charge pumps, op-amp circuits
    * etc....
  * ...that I have finally decided to make this library in order to have a "goto" reference where I can just start pulling schematic blocks for projects whenever I need to make something! 
  * PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTRIBUTE YOUR OWN DESIGNS AND BUILDING BLOCKS! Include all reference material, source documentation, links to external URLs, documentation, descriptions and explanations, spreadsheets, calculations, notes, etc., that you used to make your reference designs, or generated in the process. LEAVE NOTHING OUT! If you needed it to *build* the circuit or schematic, then we need it to *learn and understand* the circuit or schematic that you built.
